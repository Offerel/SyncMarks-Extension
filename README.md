# DAVMarks (Firefox)
This is a Webextension for Mozilla Firefox to share your bookmarks across WebDAV Shares

You can use this plugin to export and import your bookmarks to a WebDAV share of your choice. This works with known solutions like NextCloud, OwnCloud, SabreDAV or any other WebDAV providers. To logon, the most used authentication, http-basic, is supported.

The bookmarks can be exported manually or optionally fully automatically. There are corresponding options in the addon settings.

**A word of warning: A special case is the automatic import after the browser start. You should only use it, if you don't synchronize the bookmarks with any other service like Firefox Accounts. Otherwise, double bookmarking may occur.**

The exported bookmarks will also be compatible with the corresponding Roundcube plugin, so that they can also be used in Roundcube.

A version for Chrome is planned.
