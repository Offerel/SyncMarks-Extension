# DAVMarks (Firefox)
This is a Webextension for Mozilla Firefox to share your bookmarks across WebDAV Shares. You can simply install the AddOn via Mozillas [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/davmarks/) site.

You can use this plugin to export and import your bookmarks to a WebDAV share of your choice. This works with known solutions like NextCloud, OwnCloud, SabreDAV or any other WebDAV providers. To logon, the most used authentication, http-basic, is supported.

The bookmarks can be exported manually or optionally fully automatically. There are corresponding options in the addon settings.

The Export/Import process should be compatible with Firefox Sync since version 1.0 of this AddOn. But as you might know, sometimes the devils is a squirrel. So please take always a bookmark backup.

The exported bookmarks are also be compatible with the corresponding [Roundcube plugin](https://github.com/Offerel/roundcube_ffbookmarks), so that they can also be used in Roundcube.
